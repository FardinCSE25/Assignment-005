*** The difference between getElementById, getElementbyClassName, querySelector/querySelector ***

Access :
* getElementById : We can select an element of a certain id of our HTML code by using getElementById
* getElementbyClassName : We can select all the elements identified by a certain class by using getElementByClassName
* We can select a single element specifically the first element of HTML by using querySelector. We can select anything like elements of classes or tags or CSS styles.
